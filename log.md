# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Data Preprocessiong for Ether Price history dataset.

**Thoughts**: The preprocessing part itself is a little bit trickky as to which techniques to use and get the most optimised results. But am getting through it part by part and i'll be done with it soon. The next work itself should be run the optimised Dataset into my Neural Net.

### Day 1: July 8,2018

**Today's Progress**: LSTM Neural network trained for prediction. Also worked on a few future projects.

**Thoughts**: The LSTM NN came out pretty well at the end as expected. On a side note i have always planned on working on the BLizzards Starcraft2's DNN api upon which i've done some minute research and am exited to hop my pens pretty soon.
