# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Data Preprocessiong for Ether Price history dataset.

**Thoughts**: The preprocessing part itself is a little bit trickky as to which techniques to use and get the most optimised results. But am getting through it part by part and i'll be done with it soon. The next work itself should be run the optimised Dataset into my Neural Net.

### Day 1: July 8,2018

**Today's Progress**: LSTM Neural network trained for prediction. Also worked on a few future projects.

**Thoughts**: The LSTM NN came out pretty well at the end as expected. On a side note i have always planned on working on the BLizzards Starcraft2's DNN api upon which i've done some minute research and am exited to hop my pens pretty soon.

## Day 2: July 9,2018

**Today's progress**: Ether project almost finished. Progress on SC2 project.

**Thoughts**: Worked on visualizing Nomalized data which seems quite impotent. NN code pushed and is ready to be fed with some juicy data. Researched about a few more functions that can be done with the SC2 library.

## Day 3: July 10,2018

**Today's progress**: Explored Matlab and Progress on SC2.

**Thoughts**: I was exploring Matlab right here in Github to findout some really cool ways of Data visualization with my Ether project. And did also make some forward juling with the SC2 project.

## Day 4: July 11,2018

**Progress**: Made further progress on SC2 but Got stuck to a wall with the Ether project.

**Thoughts**: Discovered a major flaw in my Dataset that i need to rectify, So i have build the entire thing again which is defenitely frustrating. Disovered some intermediate level Probe apis in SC2 and it all started making sense.

## Day 5: July 12,2018

**Progress**: Progress on SC2.

**Thoughts**: Played a bit of SC2 as i could observe the strategies and 'how everything works' aspect of the game. As a whole enjoyed the whole knowing the game thing. Probably would be working on Protoss race.

## Day 6: July 13,2018

**Progress**: Progress on both the Projects(SC2 and Ether)

**Thoughts**: Worked on some basic level Protoss strats and observed how it works out with the end result. Refined the Dataset again inorder to fit it properly this time into the NN and hasnt been stupid, Yet. 

## Day -: July 26, 2018

**Progress**: None :(

**Thoughts**: Got completely offtrack as my family needed my help, Been too damn long since i've touched my laptop. Gotta quickly wrap up things with the Ether proect and start up SC2 ASAP before i get completely occupied with College stuff. COmpletely regret not being able to contribute to this challange but i really didnt have an actual choice as Family comes first.

**TIME TO PUT ATLEAST 2 HOURS A DAY FROM NOW ON TO SPEED UP THINGS**
