# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Data Preprocessiong for Ether Price history dataset.

**Thoughts**: The preprocessing part itself is a little bit trickky as to which techniques to use and get the most optimised results. But am getting through it part by part and i'll be done with it soon. The next work itself should be run the optimised Dataset into my Neural Net.

### Day 1: July 8,2018

**Today's Progress**: LSTM Neural network trained for prediction. Also worked on a few future projects.

**Thoughts**: The LSTM NN came out pretty well at the end as expected. On a side note i have always planned on working on the BLizzards Starcraft2's DNN api upon which i've done some minute research and am exited to hop my pens pretty soon.

## Day 2: July 9,2018

**Today's progress**: Ether project almost finished. Progress on SC2 project.

**Thoughts**: Worked on visualizing Nomalized data which seems quite impotent. NN code pushed and is ready to be fed with some juicy data. Researched about a few more functions that can be done with the SC2 library.

## Day 3: July 10,2018

**Today's progress**: Explored Matlab and Progress on SC2.

**Thoughts**: I was exploring Matlab right here in Github to findout some really cool ways of Data visualization with my Ether project. And did also make some forward juling with the SC2 project.

## Day 4: July 11,2018

**Progress**: Made further progress on SC2 but Got stuck to a wall with the Ether project.

**Thoughts**: Discovered a major flaw in my Dataset that i need to rectify, So i have build the entire thing again which is defenitely frustrating. Disovered some intermediate level Probe apis in SC2 and it all started making sense.

## Day 5: July 12,2018
