# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Data Preprocessiong for Ether Price history dataset.

**Thoughts**: The preprocessing part itself is a little bit trickky as to which techniques to use and get the most optimised results. But am getting through it part by part and i'll be done with it soon. The next work itself should be run the optimised Dataset into my Neural Net.
