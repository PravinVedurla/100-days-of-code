# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Data Preprocessiong for Ether Price history dataset.

**Thoughts**: The preprocessing part itself is a little bit trickky as to which techniques to use and get the most optimised results. But am getting through it part by part and i'll be done with it soon. The next work itself should be run the optimised Dataset into my Neural Net.

### Day 1: July 8,2018

**Today's Progress**: LSTM Neural network trained for prediction. Also worked on a few future projects.

**Thoughts**: The LSTM NN came out pretty well at the end as expected. On a side note i have always planned on working on the BLizzards Starcraft2's DNN api upon which i've done some minute research and am exited to hop my pens pretty soon.

## Day 2: July 9,2018

**Today's progress**: Ether project almost finished. Progress on SC2 project.

**Thoughts**: Worked on visualizing Nomalized data which seems quite impotent. NN code pushed and is ready to be fed with some juicy data. Researched about a few more functions that can be done with the SC2 library.

## Day 3: July 10,2018

**Today's progress**: Explored Matlab and Progress on SC2.

**Thoughts**: I was exploring Matlab right here in Github to findout some really cool ways of Data visualization with my Ether project. And did also make some forward juling with the SC2 project.

## Day 4: July 11,2018

**Progress**: Made further progress on SC2 but Got stuck to a wall with the Ether project.

**Thoughts**: Discovered a major flaw in my Dataset that i need to rectify, So i have build the entire thing again which is defenitely frustrating. Disovered some intermediate level Probe apis in SC2 and it all started making sense.

## Day 5: July 12,2018

**Progress**: Progress on SC2.

**Thoughts**: Played a bit of SC2 as i could observe the strategies and 'how everything works' aspect of the game. As a whole enjoyed the whole knowing the game thing. Probably would be working on Protoss race.

**Links**: Battle.net

## Day 6: July 13,2018

**Progress**: Progress on both the Projects(SC2 and Ether)

**Thoughts**: Worked on some basic level Protoss strats and observed how it works out with the end result. Refined the Dataset again inorder to fit it properly this time into the NN and hasnt been stupid, Yet. 

## Day -: July 26, 2018

**Progress**: None :(

**Thoughts**: Got completely offtrack as my family needed my help, Been too damn long since i've touched my laptop. Gotta quickly wrap up things with the Ether proect and start up SC2 ASAP before i get completely occupied with College stuff. COmpletely regret not being able to contribute to this challange but i really didnt have an actual choice as Family comes first.

**TIME TO PUT ATLEAST 2 HOURS A DAY FROM NOW ON TO SPEED UP THINGS**

## Days 7,8 : July 27,28 

**Progress**: Made much progress on SC2 project and have learnt so much.

**Thoughts**: I can clearly see myself working on the SC2 project soon enough. Learnt about XGBoost model on a demo project from a Youtuber and i am definitely going to dig deeper into this. Explored slack community and asked for help on my ether project to make it work somehow. Trying to accelerate things but am also worried about missing on any important details so trying to take it slow as and where is required.

## Days 9,10 : July 29,30

**Progress**: Progress on both SC2 and Ether proects.

**Thoughts**: Explored a few simple strategies into defeating AI bots( easy ones ovio) and i can see myself working deeper into this. Saw some youtubers working on Deeplearning with SC2 api. And i've decided to use XGBoost regression in my Ether proect along side the LSTM that i've already implemented, I thought of making an entire article comparing these two models and their results on the Ether dataset. On a similar note have worked a little bit on implementing the XGboost from conda.

## Day 11 : July 31, 2018

**Progress**: Implemented XGBoost and learnt about google cloud comp

**Thoughts**: The grand failure of XGBoost has been updated to my Ether project, It gave out a simple straight line just like LSTM and now i am doubting my Data augmentation technique and gonna look into it sometime. Explored a  lil bit about Google Cloud TPUs and to use Colabs to train our models which looked promising as i only have limited gpu power in my setup.

## Day 12 : Aug 1, 2018

**Progress**: Made progress on a brand new project

**Thoughts**: Made some digging into simple Face feature detection and decided to work on a simple face and smile detector with a few add ons from my side. 

## Day 13 : Aug 2, 2018

**Progress**: Progress on Face Detection project.

**Thoughts**: Got all the req cascading files and got the code ready. Got issues putting up the Cam module to provide active feed to the program so that it can return all the detections sketched on the canvas.

## Day 14,15 : Aug 3,4

**Progress**: Done with the Face detection project and it works allright.

**Thoughts**: Ready to start with a small image classification project or with the SC2 project. Imma paralelly go with Learning LSTMs aswell. exited for tomorrow.

## Day 16 : Aug 5

**Progress**: A bit of tuning with the Face detection. Explored a bit of LSTM seq2seq models required for Chatbots.

**Thoughts**:Will have to add a few Example output images to the Facedetection project soon. And i do see myself working on Lstm chatbots in the future once am done with the whole CV paradigm. I think imma work on GANs next, Been waiting to say this for a while now. yay

## Days 17,18 : Aug 6,7

**Progress**: Researched everything about GANs and i clearly see myself working on this real soon.

**Thoughts**: Done with the Architectural part of GANs and want to work on some Architectural Datasets thus getting my AI to generate some "Evil-Uncommon-Architectural-Structures". Which seems to be way Overwhelming than other projects considering the fact that i have to manage my college schedule aswell along with these projects.

## Days 19,20 : Aug 8,9

**Progress**: Progress on the GANs project.

**Thoughts**: There's no turning back at this point as i'm done with learning to code the GANs with KERAs along with a Portal where i get the Images from. Gonna have to work on Tuning the images to work in the GANs.

## Days 21, 22 : Aug 10,11

**Progress**: Progress on GANs

**Thoughts**: Worked on Learning the Core Architecture of GANs and this actually goes real Deep. Been going through multiple articles and Projects to get their Insights.

## Days 23, 24 : Aug 12,13

**Progress**: Progress with GANS and A bit of learning.

**Thoughts** : Been super busy with College schedule to be frank. Worked on image augmentation ripping it to get through. I'm not sure if i have enough computation power to make it through this project so i'll rescale the images to as small as possible keeping efficiency in mind. Gotta finish this project this week.

## Days 25, 26 : Aug 14,15

**Progress**: Made a simple MNIST gan instead. Done a Recommendation system with LIghtFM

**Thoughts**: Decided to make a simple MNIST generation first inorder to understand the code well enough. And also worked on Recommendation systems using LightFM. 

## Day 27 : Aug 16

**Progress**: Completely done with the MNIST gan also collected data for the Architectural buildings project.

**Thoughts**: None?


## Day 28: Aug 17

**Progress**: Image preprocessing on PokeGan project alongside started with a detailed Tensorflow course.

**Thoughts**: The idea of generating new pokemons was pretty cool and that too using DCGANs is pretty cool, so i've straight up collected data and resized it. Also started with a Tensorflow course to dig deep.

## Day 29: Aug 18

**Progress**: Learnt about Cloud ML in of the workshops.

**Thoughts**: Attended GDG's cloud ML workshop and tried out some of the pretrained models on googles cloud engine.
